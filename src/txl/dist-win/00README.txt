 Getting Started with TXL
==========================

Step 1. Install TXL

    Windows NT, 2000 or XP: 
        Run the "InstallTxl" script in this directory by double-clicking it.
        You must be the adminstrator to install TXL.

    Windows Vista:
        Make sure that the unzipped TXL distribution folder is on the Desktop.
        Right-click the "InstallTxl" script in this directory and choose
        "Run as Administrator".  Authorize the script to continue when asked.

Step 2. Learn TXL

    You'll find documentation of the TXL language, the TXL commands,
    TXL error messages and lots more on the TXL Documentation page,

        http://www.txl.ca/txldocs.html

    If you are a new user, you should begin your exploration of
    TXL by visiting the TXL learning resources page,

        http://www.txl.ca/learningtxl.html

    Begin with the guided tour of TXL, and move on to the TXL
    Challenge, a structured sequence of programming problems designed
    to introduce you to the style and paradigm of TXL.

Step 3. Visit TXL World

    Once you have learned the basics, move on to looking at the
    many examples of what others have done with TXL and how they
    have done it, on the TXL World page,

	http://www.txl.ca/txlworld.html

    There you will also find grammars and rulesets that will help
    you to get started in whatever line of source transformation
    you have in mind.

Step 4. Away You Go!

    When you're ready to tackle your own problems in TXL, keep
    in mind that you can find answers to frequently asked questions,
    ask your own questions, and report problems and bugs on the
    TXL Support page,
